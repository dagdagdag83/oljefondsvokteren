The cumulative weight of this evidence leads to the conclusion that there is an unacceptable risk that the company contributes to or is responsible for serious violations of fundamental ethical norms, making it a candidate for exclusion.",

Stated policies failed to prevent environmental violations, governance lapses, and fatal accidents within the corporate group. The framework provides no transparency on critical risks like end-user due diligence for defence products and its business with Russia, demonstrating a significant gap between stated policy and actual practice.",

The company provides no public information on its due diligence processes to prevent such diversion.",

A March 2022 statement claimed sales were 'minimal' (0.3%), but an August 2024 analyst report cited 'support from MMA exports to Russia' as a material factor for achieving profitability targets. This suggests AIL has capitalized on trade realignments to supply Russia's industrial base.",

        "dualUseNature": "AIL manufactures a wide range of chemicals with dual-use potential, particularly nitroaromatic and chlorinated compounds that can serve as precursors for explosives. Many of these chemicals fall under India's SCOMET (Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment, and Technologies) export control list, requiring licenses for export.",
        "portfolioOverview": "AIL has a dedicated 'Defence' product category featuring chemicals with direct military applications. This includes high explosives like TATB and PETN, and essential components for solid rocket propellants such as HTPB and Ammonium Perchlorate. This demonstrates an intentional and strategic focus on the defence sector.",
        "productBasedExclusionAnalysis": "The company's strategic involvement is confirmed by its official designation as an 'Indian Offset Partner' (IOP) by the Indian Ministry of Defence. This elevates AIL from a commercial supplier to a strategic partner of the Indian defence establishment, making it highly probable its 'Defence' products are supplied to military programs and increasing the risk of contribution to serious violations of the rights of individuals in war or conflict under § 3 (b)."

    "rationale": "The recommendation for exclusion is based on the cumulative and interconnected nature of identified risks. The primary drivers are the direct and intentional contribution to military capability through the production of military-grade materials, and the high-risk involvement in the Ukraine conflict by supplying Russia's industrial base. These risks are amplified by a pattern of fatal accidents, environmental non-compliance, and governance lapses, demonstrating a weak and ineffective risk management culture.",
