		<h2>I. Executive Summary</h2>
		<h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
		<p>
			This report presents a comprehensive risk assessment of the Belgian semiconductor company Melexis NV (Euronext
			Brussels: MELE). The analysis is conducted for the Council on Ethics of the Norwegian Government Pension
			Fund Global (GPFG) and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). The primary objective is to evaluate the
			company's operations, products, and corporate conduct against the criteria established in the GPFG's
			"Guidelines for Observation and Exclusion of companies from the Government Pension Fund Global."
		</p>

		<h3>Key Findings</h3>
		<p>
			The assessment reveals a complex and bifurcated risk profile for Melexis NV. The company demonstrates
			robust corporate governance, strong environmental policies, and a clear, commendable ethical stance in
			relation to Russia's unjust war against Ukraine, where it maintains a significant and supportive
			presence. However, a significant and unmitigated risk exists concerning the company's indirect
			contribution to serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war and conflict, specifically
			the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
		</p>

		<h3>Final Recommendation</h3>
		<p>
			This assessment concludes that Melexis NV's operations and business model present an unacceptable risk of
			contributing to serious violations of fundamental ethical norms, as defined by the GPFG guidelines.

		<h2>II. Corporate Profile and Global Operations</h2>
		<h3>Business Model and Market Position</h3>
		<p>
			Melexis NV is a global micro-electronic semiconductor company headquartered in Ieper, Belgium. A defining
			characteristic of Melexis's business model is its "fabless" nature, focusing on R&D while outsourcing
			wafer fabrication. The automotive sector is the cornerstone of Melexis's business, accounting for
			approximately 90% of its total revenue.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="product-criteria">
		<h2>III. Assessment Against GPFG Product-Based Exclusion Criteria (ยง 3)</h2>
		<p>
			An analysis of Melexis NV against these criteria shows no grounds for observation or exclusion. The company
			is not involved in the production of prohibited weapons, tobacco, cannabis, or thermal coal.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="conduct-criteria">
		<h2>IV. Assessment Against GPFG Conduct-Based Exclusion Criteria (ยง 4)</h2>
		<h3>ยง 4a - Serious or Systematic Human Rights Violations</h3>
		<p>
			Melexis has established a comprehensive framework of public policies regarding human rights. Despite these
			robust policies, a moderate level of risk remains due to the complexity of the global semiconductor
			supply chain, with dependencies in regions like China and Malaysia.
		</p>
		<h3>ยง 4b - Serious Violations of Individuals' Rights in Situations of War or Conflict</h3>
		<p>
			Semiconductors are a quintessential dual-use technology. The analysis reveals a high risk of Melexis's
			products contributing to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Its products are readily available in Israel
			through major global distributors, making it highly probable they are incorporated into defense systems.
		</p>

	<section id="geopolitical">
		<h2>V. Geopolitical Risk Exposure and Mitigating Factors</h2>
		<h3>Position on the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h3>
		<p>
			Melexis has taken a clear, tangible, and positive stance. The company has maintained its R&D center in
			Kyiv, Ukraine, throughout the conflict, demonstrating a willingness to align its business practices with
			fundamental ethical principles.
		</p>
		<h3>Analysis of Inconsistent Ethical Postures</h3>
		<p>
			The company's proactive, values-aligned stance on Ukraine contrasts sharply with its passive, legally
			defensive posture regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This suggests that ethical decision-making
			may be driven more by compliance and legal liability minimization.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="synthesis">
		<h2>VI. Final Risk Synthesis and Categorization</h2>
		<p>
			The company exhibits many characteristics of a responsible corporate actor but is overshadowed by the
			critical, unmitigated risk of its products contributing to serious violations of rights in the
			Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The final determination is that the risk is substantial, active, and not
			adequately managed.
