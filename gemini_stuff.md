# Logo prompt
Create a modern, minimalist logo for a website providing an ethical audit of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund. The concept is "Vakten" (The Guard), symbolizing oversight, protection, and ethical integrity.

Style:
Minimalist & Geometric: Use clean lines and simple, strong shapes.
Professional & Trustworthy: The design must feel serious and authoritative, suitable for a financial analysis tool.

Core Elements to Combine (Abstractly):
A Shield: To represent protection, security, and defense of ethical principles.
A Watchful Eye: To symbolize oversight, scrutiny, and transparency.
A Stylized "V": Integrate the letter "V" (for Vakten) into the core design. For instance, the top of the shield could form a 'V', or the eye could be shaped like a 'V'.

Color Palette:
Primary: A deep, professional navy blue (like #00205B).
Secondary: A light, neutral gray (like #EAEAEA).
Accent: A single, subtle accent of muted gold (like #D4AF37) or a clear green (like #22C55E) to represent finance or ethical purity.

Things to Avoid:
No literal illustrations of a person, a magnifying glass, or scales of justice.
No complex details or gradients. Keep it flat and clean.

Final Output:
Please provide the logo on a clean, light-colored background. Show a few variations if possible.
